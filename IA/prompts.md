### Commit message generation

The first line should be a summary of all modifications, following the format <type>(scope): <description>. The description should not exceed 50 characters (excluding type and scope).

The second line should be blank.

The third line should contain breaking changes if needed, otherwise this line should be omitted.

The remaining lines should provide a more detailed functional description in bullet points. Do not include class names or code return values.
